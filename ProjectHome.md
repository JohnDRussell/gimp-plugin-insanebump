This plug-in is a normal map generator.  It was originally written by Omar Emad.  Load a single layer picture, then choose filters map InsaneBump tweak the details and press execute.  The Normal/Diffuse/Specular/Occlusion maps for the picture will be created in the folder where the original picture resides.

What I have done here is convert Omars' code from python, dependent upon non standard plug-ins to C Language plug-in with no dependencies.  Just load the InsaneBump.exe into your plug-ins directory and that's it.

This is where I will be storing the source codes and binaries.  You can also find the binaries at the Gimp Plugin Registry.
